# Hi There ðŸ‘‹
<p>I'm Trust Jamin Okpukoro, a Frontend Engineer who loves the artistic combination of `code` and design ðŸŽ¨, thus I find passion in building sustainable, maintainable and visually compelling applications with user-friendly interaction that drive business growth and improve UX.</p>

I also have a passion for building communities and helping others, this has led me to help grow existing communities in my locality and strength existing ones. I'm currently leading the [GDG Sapele](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg) community as the Lead Organizer.
